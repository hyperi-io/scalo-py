"""Reconnect-and-retry resilience for a POOLED connection you can rebuild.

The sibling shape to :class:`~scalo.resilience.CircuitBreaker`. Where the circuit
breaker trip-and-rejects a one-shot outbound call, this reconnects and retries a
pooled connection through a transient outage: a transient error backs off and
recovers on the next success, a CONNECTION outage additionally rebuilds the pool
between attempts and may fire a warm-up hook (extending the budget to a
cold-start window). Generic over the dependency - the caller injects the error
classifiers + a name, so it serves any pooled backend (a ClickHouse client
today, another pooled connection tomorrow). Tracks an :class:`OutageState` a
readiness surface can read.
