"""Engine selection is the part that breaks silently.

Sending a Replicated form to a keeperless node hard-fails with code 36, which is
loud. The dangerous direction is the other one: a plain MergeTree on a cluster
is accepted and then splits data across replicas, so these tests pin which
inputs may produce a replicated form and which may fan DDL out with ON CLUSTER.
